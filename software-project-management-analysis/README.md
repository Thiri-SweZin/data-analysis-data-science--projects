#  Software Project Management (SPM) Classroom Evaluation

This project analyzes the effectiveness of teaching **Software Project Management (SPM)** at Mae Fah Luang University using **statistical analysis and survey data**.  
It investigates how teaching activities, content clarity, and collaboration impact students’ satisfaction and learning outcomes.

---

## Objectives
- Evaluate student satisfaction and confidence in applying SPM lessons.  
- Analyze the relationship between teaching content, collaboration, and overall learning outcomes.  
- Apply **correlation** and **Z-test** analyses to measure significance between variables.

---

##  Dataset Summary
- **Participants:** 138 students (96 male, 42 female)  
- **Key Variables:**
  - Clarity of Objectives  
  - Relevant Content  
  - Engagement in Activities  
  - Collaboration & Communication  
  - Confidence in Applying Lessons  
  - Overall Satisfaction

##  Statistical Analysis

###  Descriptive Statistics
| Metric | Mean | Interpretation |
|--------|------|----------------|
| Clarity of Objectives | 4.09 | High clarity |
| Relevant Content | 4.17 | Highly relevant |
| Engagement | 4.12 | Positive engagement |
| Collaboration | 4.20 | Strong teamwork |
| Overall Satisfaction | 4.19 | High satisfaction |

---

###  Correlation Results
- **Confidence ↔ Overall Satisfaction:** r = 0.72 (Strong Positive)  
- **Clarity ↔ Relevant Content:** r = 0.64  
- **Collaboration ↔ Learning Outcomes:** r = 0.54  

✅ Interpretation: Students who felt confident applying lessons were also more satisfied overall.

---

###  Z-Test Comparisons
| Comparison | Z-Score | p-Value | Conclusion |
|-------------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Content vs Collaboration | -0.10 | 0.919 | No significant difference |
| Content vs Overall | -0.39 | 0.692 | No significant difference |
| Collaboration vs Overall | -0.30 | 0.766 | No significant difference |

✅ Conclusion: Ratings for content, collaboration, and overall satisfaction are consistent — indicating balanced course delivery.

---

##  Key Insights
- Students struggled to connect **theory with real-world application**, suggesting the need for more **industry-based case studies**.  
- High correlation between **content clarity** and **confidence** shows that clearer goals improve learning outcomes.  
- Collaborative learning positively affects engagement and satisfaction.

---

##  Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel / Python (for data analysis)  
- Pandas, NumPy, SciPy (optional)  
- Word / Google Docs (for report writing)

---

##  Future Improvements
- Include real project simulations for hands-on learning.  
- Conduct comparative analysis between offline and online SPM classes.  
- Automate statistical analysis using Python notebooks.
